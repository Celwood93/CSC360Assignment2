This assignment is a simulation of an airport control system.
It uses pthread_cond's as its queues, using counters for each customer to guarantee they leave the queue at the correct time.
To run the code, you need to type make into the command line. This will create the binary.
To run the provided tests (in the directory testfiles) type ./runner or click the runner bash.
This will run 9 tests, which should all run to completion.
To run this manually, type in the command line "./ACS" and hit enter.
This will then prompt the user with ACS > where the user types in a text file.
The program will then run through the file (assuming it is of correct input, and it will exclude negative values).
The program will then prompt again for another file, the user can either exit or type "end" then enter to exit.


Test files cover the negative values (test file 4, 6,7,8,9) identical arrivals of customers (test 2, 5), normal case (test 1) and 1 at a time (case 3)

Having identical arrival time of customers with different process time was excluded as the only metric that could be measured, ie average process time,
would no longer be consistent and would be difficult to properly verify.
